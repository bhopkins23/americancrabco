                    <h2>Baking</h2>
                    <p>Baking is one of the simplest and most forgiving methods for cooking fish. For whole fish, preheat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. The general rule of thumb is to bake for 8-10 minutes per inch of thickness, measured at the thickest part of the fish. This high-heat method creates a beautifully cooked interior while maintaining moisture.</p>

                    <h2>Baking with Other Techniques</h2>

                    <h3>Steam While Baking</h3>
                    <p>For an even more tender result, combine baking with steaming. Add broth, wine, or citrus juices to your baking pan, then cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake at 425 degrees. The trapped steam creates a moist cooking environment that's perfect for delicate fish. Alternatively, you can create individual foil packets with fish, vegetables, and seasonings for easy cleanup and portion control.</p>

                    <h3>Pan Searing Then Baking</h3>
                    <p>For a restaurant-quality finish, start by searing your fish in an oven-proof skillet on the stovetop to create a golden crust, then transfer the entire skillet to a 425-450 degree oven to finish cooking. This technique gives you the best of both worlds: a crispy exterior and a perfectly cooked interior.</p>

                    <h2>Grilling</h2>
                    <p>Grilling is best suited for firm-fleshed finfish like swordfish, tuna, and salmon. For more delicate fish, use a grill basket to prevent the fish from falling through the grates or sticking. Plan on approximately 10 minutes of cooking time per inch of thickness for both steaks and whole fish.</p>
                    <p>For gas grills, preheat on high, then reduce to medium heat before adding fish. For charcoal grills, wait until coals are covered with gray ash and arrange them for direct heat cooking. Oil your grill grates well before adding fish to prevent sticking, and resist the urge to move the fish too soon - it will release naturally when it's ready to flip.</p>

                    <h2>Broiling</h2>
                    <p>Broiling uses intense top-down heat to cook fish quickly while adding a nutty, browned flavor to the surface. Position your oven rack about 2 inches from the heat source for thin fillets, or 4-6 inches away for thicker cuts or whole fish. Cook for 8-10 minutes per inch of thickness, or until the fish reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Watch carefully, as broiling happens quickly and fish can go from perfectly done to overcooked in moments.</p>

                    <h2>Poaching</h2>
                    <p>Poaching uses gentle, moist heat to cook fish while keeping it incredibly tender. Maintain your poaching liquid at 160-180 degrees Fahrenheit - it should barely simmer, not boil. The fish should be completely submerged in flavorful liquid such as broth, court-bouillon, or a mixture of wine, herbs, and spices.</p>
                    <p>This method works best for sturdy fish like salmon, halibut, and cod. The gentle cooking process preserves the delicate texture of the fish while infusing it with flavor from the poaching liquid. You can strain and reduce the liquid afterward to create an elegant sauce.</p>

                    <h2>How to Properly Thaw Frozen Fish</h2>

                    <h3>In Refrigerator (Safest Method)</h3>
                    <p>The best way to thaw frozen fish is in the refrigerator overnight. Place the frozen fish in a dish to catch any liquid and allow it to thaw slowly in the cold environment. This method takes planning ahead, but it's the safest and results in the best texture.</p>

                    <h3>In Cold Water</h3>
                    <p>If you need fish thawed more quickly, place it in a sealed plastic bag and submerge in cold running water for about 30 minutes. Change the water every 10 minutes if not using running water. Never use warm or hot water, as this can cause the outer portions to overcook while the inside is still frozen.</p>

                    <h3>How NOT to Thaw Fish</h3>
                    <p>Never thaw fish in warm water or at room temperature, as this encourages bacterial growth. Never use the microwave to thaw fish, as it will begin cooking the outside while the inside remains frozen, resulting in uneven texture and potentially unsafe conditions.</p>

                    <h2>Why Does Frozen Fish Turn Mushy?</h2>
                    <p>When fish is frozen slowly, large ice crystals form within the cells, rupturing cell walls. When thawed, these damaged cells leak moisture, resulting in a mushy texture. Commercial flash-freezing creates smaller ice crystals, preserving texture better.</p>
                    <p>Another common mistake is submerging frozen fish directly in water without protecting it in plastic. The fish absorbs excess water, which further contributes to a waterlogged, mushy texture. Always keep fish in sealed packaging when using the cold water thawing method.</p>
